This repo is dedicated to rewriting an old project I had with a friend, called [QED](https://github.com/TEX479/QED).
The project was written in python and fairly slow, we didn't know what we where doing and where young and naive but ambitious.
Now, I am still naive, just a tiny bit less young and I wanted to learn the programming language [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Here goes nothing.
